# robco_app() uses run_parallel() to push images to GCR, which relies on
# gcloud to get credentials. That, however, has a race condition:
# https://github.com/google/containerregistry/issues/115
# As such, we cache credentials and create a script that prints them to
# replace the racy credential helper. This script is added to to the start of
# PATH. This is harmless if run_parallel() is being used for something else.
# It also saves ~5s of CPU time.
