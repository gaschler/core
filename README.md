Google's Cloud Robotics Core is an open source platform that provides
infrastructure essential to building and running robotics solutions for business
automation. Cloud Robotics Core makes managing robot fleets easy for developers,
integrators, and operators. It enables:

* packaging and distribution of applications
* secure, bidirectional robot-cloud communication
* easy access to Google Cloud services such as ML, logging, and monitoring.

Cloud Robotics Core is open source and pre-alpha. Support is currently limited
to a small set of early access partners. We will gladly accept contributions
and feedback, but we are making no stability or support guarantees at this
point in time.
